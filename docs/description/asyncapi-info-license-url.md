# asyncapi-info-license-url

Mentioning a license is only useful if people know what the license means, so add a link to the full text for those who need it.

**Recommended:** No

**Good Example**

```yaml
asyncapi: "2.0.0"
info:
  license:
    name: MIT
    url: https://www.tldrlegal.com/l/mit
```
