# asyncapi-info-contact

Info object should contain `contact` object.

Hopefully, your API description document is so good that nobody ever needs to contact you with questions, but that is rarely the case. The contact object has a few different options for contact details.

**Recommended:** Yes

**Good Example**

```yaml
asyncapi: "2.0.0"
info:
  title: Awesome API
  version: "1.0"
  contact:
    name: A-Team
    email: a-team@goarmy.com
```
