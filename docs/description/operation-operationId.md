# operation-operationId

This operation ID is essentially a reference for the operation, which can be used to visually suggest a connection to other operations. This is like some theoretical static HATEOAS-style referencing, but it's also used for the URL in some documentation systems.

Make the value `lower-hyphen-case`, and try and think of a name for the action which does not relate to the HTTP message. Base it off the actual action being performed. `create-polygon`? `search-by-polygon`? `filter-companies`?

**Recommended:** Yes
