# asyncapi-info-license

The `info` object should have a `license` key.

It can be hard to pick a license, so if you don't have a lawyer around you can use [TLDRLegal](https://tldrlegal.com/) and [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/) to help give you an idea.

How useful this is in court is not entirely known, but having a license is better than not having a license.

**Recommended:** Yes

**Good Example**

```yaml
asyncapi: "2.0.0"
info:
  license:
    name: MIT
```
